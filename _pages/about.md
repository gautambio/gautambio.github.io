Hey, thanks for stopping by! 👋

Hi, I’m Gautam! 🚀 I’m a Research Fellow in the Computational Cell Structural Biology Lab at IIT Roorkee, working under Prof. [Jitin Singla](https://www.iitr.ac.in/~BT/Jitin_Singla).

Our lab delves into the molecular and mesoscale architecture of cells, developing computational methods to unravel the complexities of biological systems, tackling exciting challenges in computational and structural biology. You can explore some of our projects [here](https://www.jitinsingla.in/research/projects).

I’m deeply passionate about computational biology, with a special interest in intrinsically disordered proteins, computational neuroscience, and exploring the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. I also enjoy exploring the intersection of art and science, finding ways to visualize complex scientific ideas to make them more accessible and inspiring.

Beyond science, I’m an amateur photographer and filmmaker with a passion for capturing stories through visuals. From wildlife to human narratives, my work has earned recognition in several competitions. I love crafting short films that blend art and emotion, striving to merge creativity with the analytical rigor of science. Whether it's framing the perfect shot or running molecular dynamics simulations, I’m always drawn to the beauty of precision and storytelling.

When I’m not working in the lab or behind the camera, you might find me gearing up for my next trek, designing outreach initiatives for students, or staring at the stars (both metaphorically and literally). 🌌🍳📸

Prior to IIT, I received my Bachelor’s degree from Panjab University in Biophysics where I was awarded the Panjab University Gold Medal. I was an Indian Academy of Science summer research fellow at [JNCASR](https://www.jncasr.ac.in/home), where I was advised by Prof. [T. Govindaraju](https://www.jncasr.ac.in/faculty/tgraju) on Alzheimer's disease.

Please refer to the [CV](https://gautambio.github.io/cv/) section for details about my career path, experiences and extracurricular activities.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
